# How I'm making an open notebook

##GitHub account.

I previously had an accOunt at github
If not, follow these directions:  http://help.github.com/ particularly

> Generate an SSH keypair â€“ If you have troubles
> Set your user and email in git

It is a little convoluted with SSH keys, but not too bad.

##Create an open notebook repository

Create a new repository
Follow their directions on initial local content and first commit:
 mkdir hapnotes
 cd hapnotes
 git init
 touch README
 git add README
 git commit -m 'first commit'
 git remote add origin git@github.com:hpiwowar/hapnotes.git
 git push origin master

Go to repository page: http://github.com/hpiwowar/hapnotes

Click "Admin" button near the top of the page
Wikis is checked
click the "Upgrade" button to upgrade to new version of wikis
 
Now can see the wiki here:  http://github.com/hpiwowar/hapnotes/wiki
And because I'm never going to use it, I disable the previous wiki version with the "Disable Classic Wikis" button at the bottom of this page

## Now create a wiki page
Markdown reference:  http://www.darkcoding.net/software/markdown-quick-reference/
Save it in the open notebook directory structure, I used a .txt extension

Then in the command line, above it, use
 localhost:hapnotes hpiwowar$ git add .

then to see it:
 git status

Now commit it and push it

 localhost:hapnotes hpiwowar$ git status
 # On branch master
 # Changes to be committed:
 #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
 #
 #	new file:   meta/steps_starting_github_wiki_notebook.txt
 #
 localhost:hapnotes hpiwowar$ git commit -m "add steps on how to start github wiki notebook"
